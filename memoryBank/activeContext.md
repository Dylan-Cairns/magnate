# Active Context

## Current Focus

- Initializing the Magnate project memory bank.
- Ensuring all core documentation files are present and up to date.

## Recent Changes

- projectBrief.md, systemPatterns.md, and techContext.md have been added.
- Memory bank initialization process started.

## Next Steps

- Create and maintain progress.md to track project status and evolution.
- Begin implementation of the TypeScript core engine as described in the project brief.
- Set up initial project structure and development environment.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- Strict adherence to official Magnate rules.
- All code and documentation must be deterministic, testable, and reproducible.
- Maintain clear separation between engine, UI, bridge, and training components.

## Insights & Learnings

- The memory bank is the single source of truth for project context and must be updated after every significant change.
- Documentation is critical for continuity due to Cline's stateless nature.
