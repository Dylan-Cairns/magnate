# Progress

## What Works

- Memory bank core files (projectBrief.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, activeContext.md, progress.md) are now present and initialized.

## What's Left to Build

- TypeScript core engine (pure reducers, state, actions, legality, scoring, RNG)
- React UI (browser play, human vs bot)
- Node bridge (JSON API for training)
- Rules-based opponent (required before any RL tools)
- Python trainer (RL loop, PPO, baselines)
- Static model export and browser inference
- Testing: unit, snapshot, property tests
- Deployment: static build for GitHub Pages
- Reinforcement learning tools and training (to be added only after a working rules-based opponent is complete)

## Current Status

- Memory bank initialized and up to date as of 2025-09-02.
- Ready to begin core engine and supporting system implementation.

## Known Issues

- None at this stage.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Initial focus is on strict rules parity, determinism, and reproducibility.
- Documentation-first workflow established to support Cline's stateless operation.

_Progress file initialized on 2025-09-02._
